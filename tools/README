The tools in this directory must be run when the current working directory
is the slx-admin root.

Warning: These scripts are very quick and dirty, so make sure to ONLY run
them if your working set is clean, so you can check "git diff" first and
revert easily if something goes wrong.


-- move-lang-files.sh
This is supposed to be run first.
Move translation files from ./lang/... to ./modules/<mod>/lang/...
Pass either "modules" or "templates" as parameter

-- convert-modules.php
Run on the command line via
"php tools/convert-modules.php"
This is supposed to somewhat intelligently merge and rearrange most
of the remaining translations from the global lang directory to the
respective modules.


After running both scripts, double-check the git diff output and the
web interface itself if in doubt.
