Design Guidelines
=================

Buttons on the right-hand side if possible.

Button order from left to right: secondary action (cancel etc), primary action (save etc)

Single buttons: normal size, glyphicon and text
Multiple buttons with the same action (e.g. in a table): btn-sm, glyphicon only, no text

Button colors:
    Action with irreversible consequences (e.g. delete) = red (btn-danger) 
    Primary action (e.g. save) = blue (btn-primary)
    Add/Create = green (btn-success)
    speciel actions (e.g. send test mail) = yellow (btn-warning)
    Secondary action (e.g. cancel) = white (btn-default)
    
Preferred glyphicons:
    add (create) = glyphicon-plus
    add (assign) = glyphicon-share-alt
    delete = glyphicon-trash
    remove = glyphicon-remove
    save = glyphicon-floppy-disk
    edit = glyphicon-edit
    cancel = no glyphicon
    reset = glyphicon-refresh
    help = glyphicon-question-sign
    download = glyphicon-download-alt
    settings = glyphicon-cog
    
Tables should be sortable if it makes sense (using the stupidtable-plugin).
Every column should have a heading.

Bootstrap styled checkboxes and radiobuttons

Modals with an action should have a cancel button.
Info-modals without an action: no buttons in footer. only x-button in the top right corner to close the modal.

Modals instead of confirm()

Module heading in the top left corner

Subheadings in panels

Saving changes only after using the save button
