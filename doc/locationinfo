    configupdate: Time interval the config gets updated (in minutes)
    scaledaysauto: [true] if true it finds automatically the daystoshow parameter depending on display size


All the optional parameters will overwrite the config settings in the admin panel. If more then one room is shown,then it will
overwrite it for all rooms.

2. Add an overlay
=================
First you need an Image(svg,png,jpg), add it to ./locationinfo/frontend/img/overlay.
You can add your own css class if you want. To do so create an css  calss named .overlay-YOUR_IMAGE_NAME in the doorsign.html.
You can find an example in the doorsign.html called ".overlay-rollstuhl".
The backend functionaltiy is right now not implemented since it relays on the roominfo module.
But you can add it manually.
You need to add the image name (without ending) in the machine database on the position column with the key overlays in an array.

For example (the name of the images could be overlay1.jpg, overlay1.svg):

{"gridRow":"41","gridCol":"48","itemlook":"pc-south", "overlays":["overlay1","overlay2"]}


3.Tipps & Tricks
==================

-if you show 2-3 rooms in mode 1, it's useful to use vertical mode.
-if calendar items don't fit, show less days or if in mode 1 give the calendar more space(calendar width);
-it is possible to use different modes if you show more then one room
